## Tools
- node v14.16.0
- yarn 
  - `npm install --global yarn`

`yarn`

- There should be 4 test cases
 - 20 generations (the output is in the testcase)
 - 1st test case
 - 2nd test case
 - 3rd test case

`yarn test`

## Notes
- The design was to write small functions that can be tested.
- It's a little verbose for debugging, that should change with enough unit testing.
